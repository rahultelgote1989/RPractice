## to know about your dataframe in detail
str(writers_df)

## to get the names of the dataframe
names(writers_df)

## to get the name of the columns of dataframe
colnames(writers_df)

## to get row names of the dataframe
rownames(writers_df)

## Assiging new column and rownames to the dataframe
colnames(writers_df) = c("Age.At.Death", "Age.As.Writer", "Name", "Surname", "Gender", "Death")
rownames(writers_df) = c("ID1", "ID2", "ID3", "ID4")

## dimentions of dataframe, will result like: <number of rows> <number of columns>
dim(writers_df)

## get number of rows and columns
dim(writers_df)[1]  #number of rows
dim(writers_df)[2]  #number of columns

nrow(writers_df)
ncol(writers_df)

length(writers_df) # only gives number of rows

## access the elements of dataframe
#access columns by entering the data frame's name in combination with the variable name
writers_df$Surname
writers_df['Name']

writers_df[1:3]       #will give columns from 1st to 3rd
writers_df[1:3, 2]    #will give columns from 1st to 3rd for 2nd row
